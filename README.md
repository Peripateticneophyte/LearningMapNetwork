The goal of this is to be explained in a youtube video

Tags can be customized as per your liking. I describe programming environments as 
anything that is different enough from the main language you are programming in
to require new syntax or a large subset of knowledge. Example: Vulkan
You can know C++, but knowing C++ is not enough to be able to understand vulkan.
You have to understand vulkan as a separate entity before you can program well with it.
Another example: Python and matplotlib, or even python and scipy.
